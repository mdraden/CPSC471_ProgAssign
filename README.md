First you have to run the server side code. To do this in one terminal you can run:

```bash
write server side start up here
```

Afterwards you then can run the client side code. To do this you can do this in another terminal with:

```bash
write client side start up here
```

Once both are started up and connected you should be prompted with

```bash
'Enter command (ls, get<file>, put<file>, quit):'
```

### ls
